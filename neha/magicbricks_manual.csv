Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Sector 79, Gurgaon",1.70 Cr,2 BHK Flats,Rs 6762,404,10 Acre,N/A,"Club House, Coffee Lounge & Restaurants, Cafeteria/Food Court, Jogging and Strolling Track, Outdoor Tennis Courts, Cycling & Jogging Track, Barbeque Pit, Dance Studio, Power Back Up, Swimming Pool, Lift, Security, Park, Reserved Parking, Visitor Parking, Gymnasium, Indoor Games Room, Kids Club, Flower Gardens, Library And Business Centre, Rain Water Harvesting, Water Storage, Multipurpose Courts, Meditation Area, Conference Room, Outdoor Tennis Courts, Event Space & Amphitheatre, Fire Fighting Equipment",28,"Property has Excellent Connectivity. | The Project is on the 60 m Sector Road. | 2.5 Km from the National Highway 8. | Project is near Sector 80, 1 Manesar, 82, 81, 78, 82A and 83 among others areas. | Hospitals such as Shri Balaji Hospital and DLF Primary Health Centre are situated nearby. | The construction of Dwarka Expressway will lead to more and more purchasers investing in the property thus, making the price high. | Within close proximity to New Delhi via metro service, cabs, bus service, and 8 lane expressways thereby, making your travel easy. | Gurgaon is now preferred as one of the best commercial and residential sports in the country with NH-8 connecting New Delhi to Mumbai and also connecting Gurgaon to these many cities. | ITC Golf Resort – 12 Minute | Rockland Hospital – 5 Minute | Golden Green Golf Club – 5 Minute | Innovative Mall – 2 Minute | Karma Lake lands – 2 Minute | USP:

It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Sector 106, Gurgaon",4.13 Cr,"2,3,4 BHK Flats",Rs 9865,700,15 Acre,N/A,"Club House, Jogging and Strolling Track, Outdoor Tennis Courts, Cycling & Jogging Track, Power Back Up, Swimming Pool, Lift, Security, Park, Reserved Parking, Visitor Parking, Intercom Facility, Maintenance Staff, Gymnasium, Indoor Games Room, Flower Gardens, Rain Water Harvesting, RO Water System, Water Storage, Air Conditioned, Indoor Squash & Badminton Courts, Mini Cinema Theatre, Earth quake resistant, Health club with Steam / Jaccuzi, Fire Fighting Equipment",25,"Located just off the upcoming Dwarka Expressway. | A 3-storeyed Clubhouse sprawling over 6132 sq m with the best of international brand associations. | Over 86% of open & green spaces with over 3.6 acres of central green expanse. | A top-notch 4-tier security to keep you and your close ones safe at all times. | International brand associations like Holyfield gyms, Elle Spa & Salon, Art of Shavin.","3 kms. from the Delhi border. | Connectivity to the IGI Airport. | Upcoming India Convention Centre. | Schools like Delhi Public School, Euro International School. | Godrej Properties got over 200 awards and recognitions in last 3 years | One of Delhi/NCR's biggest clubhouse measuring 6132 sq.mt (66,000 sq.ft) | Green spaces spanning 12 acres | Ramona Braganza's exclusive fitness studio | Located off an 8-lane, 150 m wide expressway linking Dwarka to Gurugram | Godrej Properties got over 200 awards and recognitions in last 3 years | One of Delhi/NCR's biggest clubhouse measuring 6132 sq.mt (66,000 sq.ft) | Green spaces spanning 12 acres | Ramona Braganza's exclusive fitness studio | Located off an 8-lane, 150 m wide expressway linking Dwarka to Gurugram","FLOOR: MARBLE

Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Sector 49, Gurgaon",,"3,4 BHK Flats",Rs 13824,865,10 Acre,"3,4","Club House, Private Terrace/Garden, Lift, Park, Reserved Parking, Air Conditioned, Modular Kitchen, High Ceiling, Health club with Steam / Jaccuzi, Large Clubhouse, Large Open space, Multipurpose Hall, CCTV Camera, Kids play area, Half basketball court, Badminton court",16,VRV air conditioning | Provision for home automation | Private terrace & basement | Green central park with kids play area | Dedicated lift & car parking | Over 1 lakh sq. ft. clubhouse next door | CCTV surveillance & video door phone | Located on main 60 meter sector road | Strategically located at Golf Course Extension Road,,"Towers6

Middle class India, on its ride along the country&rsquo;s growth story, was desperate for good quality housing that was hard to find in its budget range.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Sector 89, Gurgaon",4.99 Cr,"2,3,4 BHK Flats",Rs 13375,180,14 Acre,"2,3,4","Club House, Jogging and Strolling Track, Cycling & Jogging Track, Power Back Up, Swimming Pool, Lift, Security, Reserved Parking, Visitor Parking, Intercom Facility, Banquet Hall, Guest Accommodation, Gymnasium, Indoor Games Room, Rain Water Harvesting, Water Storage, Multipurpose Courts, Meditation Area, Modular Kitchen, Waste Disposal, CCTV Camera, Fire Sprinklers, Kids play area, Sewage treatment plant, Aesthetically designed landscape garden, Community Hall, Fire Fighting Equipment",27,"Lavish Double - Height Lobbies | Rooftop Olympic - Length Pool | Secured Homes | 1.4 Km Of Health Loop | 41,000+ sqft 4 Levels Of Clubhouse | 100 M Athletic Tracks | Open Air Theatre | Butterfly Garden | Separate Kids Pool | National Highway 48 is easily accessible | Northern Peripheral Road: Easy Access | Indira Gandhi Airport is 20 minutes away by car | The proposed interstate bus terminal is located adjacent to this site | Close to Metro Station. | Dwarka Expressway is nearby | Surrounded by new residential, commercial, and industrial developments | Near schools, hospitals and shopping centers",,"Size: 14.25 acres of land → Towers: 8 towers, each with over 35 stories → Apartments: 900 apartments in various configurations, including 2, 3, and 4 BHKs

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Sector 85, Gurgaon",3.30 Cr,"2,3,4 BHK Flats",Rs 11743,601,10 Acre,"2,3,4","Club House, Cafeteria/Food Court, Bar/Lounge, Outdoor Tennis Courts, Barbeque Pit, Power Back Up, Swimming Pool, Lift, Security, Park, Reserved Parking, Visitor Parking, Intercom Facility, Maintenance Staff, Banquet Hall, Gymnasium, Indoor Games Room, Kids Club, Laundry Service, Water Storage, Air Conditioned, Indoor Squash & Badminton Courts, Meditation Area, Internet/Wi-Fi Connectivity, Kids Play Pool With Water Slides, Fire Fighting Equipment",26,Residential apartments with all types of modernized amenities | Perfect for people of all ages | 10x enhanced air quality with CTFA systems | It helps keep you and your loved ones leading a healthy life. | RERA and all other approvals are in place as mandated by the state authority. | It is one of the most sought-after locations in Gurugram. | Posh metropolis | Well-connected to the City Center and other prime locations of the city | Profitable investment option | 6 mins* drive time to Delhi Public School - Sector 84 | 30 mins* drive time to VPS Hospital Rockland - Sector 5 | 8 mins* drive time to Sapphire Mall - Sector 83 | 8 mins* drive time to Reliance Trends - Sector 83 | 15 mins* drive time to Eros Corporate Park - Sector 2,,"Residential apartments with all types of modernized amenities

Menon founded SOBHA Limited in 1995 with a clear vision to """"transform the way people perceive quality"""". Today, SOBHA, a Rs. 40 billion company, is the most trusted brand and only backward integrated real estate player in the country.Since inception, the Company has always strived for benchmark quality, customer centric approach, robust engineering, in-house research, uncompromising business ethics, timeless values and transparency in all spheres of business conduct, which have contributed in making it a preferred real estate brand in India. In 2006, SOBHA went public through its initial public offering, an event that created history when the issue got oversubscribed a record 126 times.Headquartered in Bengaluru, SOBHA is primarily focused on residential and contractual projects. The Company&rsquo;s residential projects include presidential villas, row houses, luxury and super luxury apartments, plotted developments and aspirational homes replete with world-class amenities. In all its residential projects, the company lays a strong emphasis on environmental management, rain water harvesting and high safety standards. On the contracts side, the Company has constructed a wide variety of structures for corporates including corporate offices, convention centres, software development blocks, multiplex theatres, hostel facilities, guest houses, food courts, restaurants, research centres and club houses. Some of SOBHA&rsquo;s prestigious corporate clients include Infosys, Taj Group, Dell, HP, Timken, Biocon, Institute of Public Enterprises (IPE), Bosch, Hotel Leela Ventures and others.Today, with presence across 27 cities in India,&nbsp; SOBHA has an impeccable track record of timely delivering 474 real estate &amp; contractual projects with over 109 million sq.ft. of area in the last 24 years.The backward integration model is one of the key competitive strengths of SOBHA. This ensures that the Company has control not only over the supply but more importantly over the quality of the materials it uses in construction activities. SOBHA has all the competencies and in-house resources to deliver a project from conceptualisation to completion. Backward integration includes an interiors division, a metal works and glazing factory and a concrete products factory. SOBHA has also diversified into retail business with spring mattresses under the brand name &lsquo;SOBHA Restoplus&rsquo;. More than 27 variants of mattresses are produced by the mattress division using cutting-edge machinery of international quality.SOBHA is renowned for its world-class products. The Company conforms to the ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certifications for its quality, safety and environment management systems.As a responsible corporate citizen, SOBHA&rsquo;s CSR activities encompass the areas of education, providing healthcare facilities and helping the aged, single mothers, children and others in need of financial and other assistance. The CSR activities are primarily undertaken through a public charitable trust, the Sri Kurumba Educational and Charitable Trust.Some of the key social projects undertaken by the Trust are (a) SOBHA Hermitage, a unique senior citizens&rsquo; and widows&rsquo; home with world-class amenities, (b) SOBHA Health Care, a primary health centre with best-in-class facilities for medical treatment, (c) SOBHA Academy, an exclusive educational institution for the underprivileged children, (d) SOBHA Icon, another educational initiative to improve the standards of Government school students in higher classes, (e) SOBHA rural women empowerment, (f) social rehabilitation scheme for the people of the three backward panchayats.SOBHA has been honoured with several prestigious awards by various institutions of repute.

Max Heiights Majestic,R28336,"What I like about the project:

I've been living here for about six months now, and overall it's a very good group housing society. It's located at Sikar Road in Suncity, Jaipur, which is a definite plus for me. The location is really convenient for getting around.

What I don't like:

However, there are some things I've noticed that I'm not so happy about. If you wander around the garden, which is fantastic, be sure to check out the basement areas, the lifts, and the balconies too. Some of those common areas are a bit scary.","What I like about the project:

I recently visited Max Heights, and as a prospective buyer for a small family, I found it quite suitable. The overall experience of seeing the place was good. If you're looking for a reasonably priced home, it's definitely something you could consider. I think for a small family starting out, it has potential. We are thinking of purchasing here after staying nearby for a while.

What I don't like:

One thing that's worth considering, though, is the location. It's situated quite far inside from the main road. So, if you don't own a car or have reliable transportation, it could be difficult to move around and get out of the place easily. That's the main concern after living nearby for this long, we see the impact on getting groceries or going to work if you don't have a car.",
ALTA,R2966,"What I like about the project:

I've been living here for about six months now, and what I appreciate most is the peaceful atmosphere. It really does feel like a little haven away from the hustle and bustle of the city. It is slightly far, but the apartment layout is great, especially the ventilation, and there's definitely enough space to walk around, which is a big plus for me. If you work around Siruseri, this could be a good fit, otherwise it's ideal for those who want a quiet retirement community apartment.

What I don't like:

It's a decent apartment complex, but it's important to remember it's a budget-friendly option. So, you shouldn't come in expecting all the high-end, luxurious amenities. While there is a gym, it's really just functional. It's perfectly adequate, but don't expect state-of-the-art equipment.","What I like about the project:

I've been living here for a few months now, and there are definitely some good points. The apartment itself is nice enough, and having a supermarket right inside the complex is super convenient. Parking has also been pretty good, I've never had trouble finding a spot. It seems like it would be a good place for families who are renting.

What I don't like:

Honestly, if you're thinking about renting here, you should really do your homework. Don't just look at the pictures of the swimming pool. Take a close look at the lifts in a few different towers, that will give you a good idea of how well things are maintained. Also, check things like the lights, water taps, and toilet flushes when you visit. The maintenance is really lacking. Getting them to fix anything takes forever, like a week sometimes, and you're often stuck paying for the repairs yourself. You should also check the water color in the bathrooms and kitchen before moving in.","What I like about the project:

I've been living in G block for about six months now, and I really appreciate that it's a nice, gated community. It gives a sense of security and privacy, which is something I was definitely looking for. I also like that it's primarily residential; you won't find hotels or a bunch of random shops inside the gates. There's just one grocery store, which is convenient for the basics.

What I don't like:

On the other hand, the rent and deposit do feel a bit high compared to other places around here. It's also a bit inconvenient that if you need anything beyond groceries, you have to travel a good 4 to 5 kilometers. The maintenance charges also feel pretty heavy, especially considering the amenities aren't exactly top-notch. Plus, there's no bus stop nearby and the network coverage isn't great. Also, the supermarket inside has really high prices, making it hard to rely on it."
Risinia Skyon,R370626,"What I like about the project:

I've been living here since October of last year, and overall it's been a pretty good experience. The community is made up of six towers, plus a clubhouse. With a total of 754 flats, it's a big place, but it generally feels peaceful, which is a big plus for me. It's a great place to live if you are looking for a society to live in.

What I don't like:

One thing I've noticed, and it's been a bit of a downside, is the dust and noise levels. It can get pretty dusty here, and sometimes it feels like there's always some kind of noise going on. Connectivity is good. For people sensitive to dust or noise, it might not be ideal.","What I like about the project:

I've been living here for about six months now, and one thing I really appreciate is the feeling of security. It's a spacious, gated community which gives you a certain peace of mind. I also like the clubhouse; it has some really great facilities that are a nice bonus.

What I don't like:

Honestly, since we moved in, we've run into a few issues. I won’t go into too much detail, but things haven't been as smooth as we'd hoped. Based on my experience, I wouldn't be quick to recommend it.","What I like about the project:

I've been living here since October 2023, and overall, it's been a pretty good experience. The society is quite large, with six towers and a clubhouse, making it feel like a proper community. There are a total of 754 flats, and I've found it to be a generally peaceful and great place to live.

What I don't like:

One thing that bothers me is the size of the flats. They're on the smaller side, around 800 square feet, and considering the price, I think they could be a bit more spacious. Also, the buildings are positioned quite close to each other. This means you can easily see into other people's rooms, and they can see into yours, which isn't ideal for privacy."
Nimbus Express Park View 2 Low Rise,R379918,"What I like about the project:

I've been living here for over a year now, and honestly, it's a great place to live. It's perfect for families, and the community has a lot to offer. We have a clubhouse, gym, swimming pool, table tennis, basketball, cricket, and badminton, so there's always something to do and ways to keep active. I really appreciate having all these amenities right here.

What I don't like:

Sadly, I have some concerns that have come up since moving in. While the structure itself seems well-built for the price, the upkeep of everything promised has been a real struggle. A big issue is the water leaking into the basement from different spots like expansion joints, damaged pipes, and a blocked drain system. This leaking water causes seepage, which is worrying because it could weaken the pillars and also creates a bad smell and mosquito problem. We also have frequent lift breakdowns, which is a safety concern, and it seems like security needs some improvement, too.","What I like about the project:

I think this place is a good option for residents because it has all the facilities you'd need. We experienced it firsthand when we stayed in an Airbnb here for four days and found everything quite convenient. It’s definitely a plus to have everything you need right where you live.

What I don't like:

After living here for a while, the maintenance is really concerning. Things don't seem to be getting fixed properly, and it's a bit frustrating. Security is also a worry. I don’t always feel completely safe, and there's definitely room for improvement in that area. It makes you think twice.","What I like about the project:

I've been living here for about six months now, and one thing I really appreciate is the location. Being in Greater Noida, right off the Yamuna Expressway, makes it surprisingly peaceful. It's definitely a quieter atmosphere compared to the hustle and bustle of Noida. Plus, you can't beat the prices – both buying and renting seem much more affordable than what you'd find in Noida proper.

What I don't like:

Honestly, while I enjoy the peace and quiet, there are definitely some drawbacks. It doesn't really feel like the ideal place for families to settle down. I've noticed the corridors and lifts aren't always well-maintained, and the security could definitely be improved. It seems to cater more to single folks, maybe even a bit too much in that direction. It's something to seriously consider before deciding to move in."

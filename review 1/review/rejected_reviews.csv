Windsor Troika,R206111,"Windsor Troika is a rare breed among the long list of builders in Bangalore and a game changer in the real estate market. We have recently booked a 3BHK apartment and must confess that our apartment, common amenities, building complex, construction quality and pricing have exceeded all our expectations. We are indeed lucky and blessed to have this deal worked out in a seamless manner by a team of efficient CRM and Sales staff at Windsor. The property at Akshaya Nagar is considered a strategic and growing location, between the yellow and pink metro lines. This makes it attractive for working professionals to commute to their main work locations across Bengaluru. The complex is located in a serene and peaceful environment with well-maintained common areas, broad walkways, beautiful gardens, infinity pool, tennis court, badminton court and cricket practice pitch to name a few highlights. The Multistoried car parking is rare to witness in apartment complexes and this saves a lot of space for the owners. While we have visited many complexes, Windsor Troika is definitely unique. Firstly, the land is not cluttered with multiple towers. A simple model with all major amenities and just two towers spread around 4 -5 Acres shared among 330 apartments gives everyone a lot of living and breathing space. Needless to say, one gets quite a bit of undivided property share. While there is definitely a good sense of community living, one can utilize these top-class amenities without waiting in long queues, quite common with large apartment complexes having many towers with shared amenities. We would like to sincerely thank MD Srinivas Rao for being kind enough and allocating us two adjacent car parking spaces at the floor of our choice. We sincerely wish him all the very best for his future endeavors and hope that Windsor Edifices gets listed in the equity markets and reach greater heights with a large market capitalization.",5.0,Focuses on sales team/process rather than actual living experience; Review is overly positive with excessive praise or focuses on construction status

Pareena Mi Casa,R22804,"The only positive aspect of this society is that the flats are spacious and well-designed, offering ample living space. However, the overall experience is far from satisfactory. The construction quality is poor, with seepage issues appearing within the first year itself. The maintenance team is highly unresponsive, often ignoring complaints or taking weeks—sometimes even months—to resolve basic issues. One of the biggest concerns is electricity. Despite having a DG backup, power cuts are frequent, especially during summer, as the management seems to prefer running on DG to charge higher rates. While all nearby societies, including those around Pareena Micassa, have electricity, this society conveniently remains without power, as per the maintenance team’s explanation. The maintenance charges are also unreasonably high, yet the services provided are subpar. Another major drawback is the internet service. No external internet providers are allowed because the society has an exclusive tie-up with a local vendor, whose service is highly unreliable. Frequent disruptions make it frustrating, and to make matters worse, residents are forced to purchase the in-house Wi-Fi just to get an extension. Overall, the society functions in a monopolistic manner, prioritizing profits over resident welfare. Even rural areas seem to have better electricity availability than what is provided here.",1.0,Unknown reason

No authority lies with the people sitting in their FMD department and they never respond to tenants over email and if you want to discuss anything they never pick tenants phone. Simply, tenant can not talk and discuss with management for anything. In winters it’s too cold to live and in summers it’s too hot. No proper system of water, dg backup and lots of things despite this they are charging maintenance heavily.

Sewage water(Waste Water) also depends on the Sewage tankers. Wastage management also depends on the private cleaners. For basic amenities you should travel at-least of 3-4 kms.

Nimbus Express Park View 2 Low Rise,R379918,"I feel sad about dropping a review about the society where I live. Structure quality is good at this competitive price, and the maintenance and the management of amenities promised by the builder became a headache to all of us. We all are afraid for our safety nowadays based on the following points: - Water leaking to the basement from various places (expansion joints, damaged pipes, blocked drain system, etc.) - Leak water in the basement creates seepage, weakening the pillars, creating a bad smell, spreading mosquitos, etc. - Frequent breakdown of lifts. Randomly freezes on any floor and the rescue system barely works. - Security is a big concern here - The maintenance team is not up to the mark I've attached photos of the present situation of the project. Have a look at those.",2.0,Unknown reason

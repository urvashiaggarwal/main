Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Hinjewadi Phase 3, Pune",71 Lac,"1,2,3 BHK Flats",Rs 6542,N/A,N/A,"1,2,3",,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,Residential,Flat,Under Construction,N/A,1-Oct-30,N/A

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Bhandup West, Mumbai",1.96 Cr,"2,3 BHK Flats",Rs 16000,600,26795 Sq-m,"2,3","Club House, Swimming Pool, Lift, Park, Reserved Parking, Gymnasium, Rain Water Harvesting, Waste Disposal, Large Open space, Kids play area, Sewage treatment plant, Aesthetically designed landscape garden, Fire Fighting Equipment",13,"A well- connected address and ultimate choice for residential living | The project offers well designed luxurious homes | Lavish clubhouse, dedicated child-centric amenities, and expansive green spaces that let you create unforgettable memories, every day | CSMI Airport, 14.1 Km | Central Railway Bhandup, 2.3 Km | R Mal, 3.2 Km | Lakeside Chalet, 10.0 Km | O2 Business Commercial Park, 1.8 Km | Athlon Sports, 2.6 Km | Gold oak, 7.3 Km | Eastern Express Highway, 4.7 Km | Tortoise Amusement Park, 15.6 Km | Juhu Beach, 18.8 Km | Lower Malad, 19.6 Km",,RCC framed strategically constructed structure keeping in mind the best of architecture and specifications both from inside as well as outside.,Residential,Flat,Under Construction,1-May-24,1-Mar-31,3

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Indira Nagar, Bangalore",2.20 Cr,3 BHK Flats,Rs 13158,300,6 Acre,3,"Club House, Cycling & Jogging Track, Power Back Up, Swimming Pool, Lift, Security, Reserved Parking, Gymnasium, Indoor Games Room, Indoor Squash & Badminton Courts, Multipurpose Courts, Meditation Area, Multipurpose Hall, CCTV Camera, Kids play area, Cricket net practice, Aesthetically designed landscape garden, Event Space & Amphitheatre",18,Greco-Roman Themed Homes | Italian Marble Flooring | EV Charging Points For Every Parking | Temperature Controlled Swimming Pool,Manipal Hospital - 20 min | Phoenix Marketcity - 25 min | New Horizon College - 20 min | Summer Hill Kids Preschool - 1 min | International Tech Park Bangalore (ITPB) - 35 min,"RCC Structure with cement block masonry

Founded in 1986, the group's turnover is today in excess of Rs. 3518 Cr (for FY 15); a leap that has been inspired by CMD Irfan Razack and marshaled by his brothers Rezwan Razack and Noaman Razack. Having completed 210 projects covering over 80 million sq ft sq ft, currently the company has 53 ongoing projects spanning 54 million sq ft sq ft and 35 upcoming projects aggregating to 48 million sq ft sq ft of world-class real estate space across asset classes.

While, the government initiated the supply-side measures, it has simultaneously addressed the demand-side, too; by boosting the affordability with the reduction/subsidy in interest on housing loans, enhancement of ceiling for interest deduction, etc. Further, with implementation of path-breaking regulations - RERA and GST Act; the real estate business started getting the much needed impetus as an industry. The accordance of much coveted status of &ldquo;Infrastructure&rdquo; to Affordable Housing set the right atmosphere. Hence, with such collective positive transformation of critical dynamics of the real-estate industry; it was thought prudent to provide an undisturbed attention to the real-estate business by demerging it into a separate entity. The independent Real Estate Business would ensure a focused strategy and specialization for sustainable growth of the Real Estate Business while it would also support the initiatives taken by the Government to provide affordable housing.NI Ltd has been scaling new heights since its inception in the year 1990. In its journey of 31+ years, NI Ltd has built for itself an enviable position engaging in turnkey civic urban infrastructure developments besides soaring high in new generation lifestyles in the real estate space. The name Nila is synonymous with excellence. As a Sambhaav Group company and headquartered at Ahmedabad, NI Ltd has evolved over the years from its primary identity of a realty company to one which is now predominantly involved in the Affordable Housing.

Founded in 1986, the group's turnover is today in excess of Rs. 3518 Cr (for FY 15); a leap that has been inspired by CMD Irfan Razack and marshaled by his brothers Rezwan Razack and Noaman Razack. Having completed 210 projects covering over 80 million sq ft sq ft, currently the company has 53 ongoing projects spanning 54 million sq ft sq ft and 35 upcoming projects aggregating to 48 million sq ft sq ft of world-class real estate space across asset classes. In October 2010, the Prestige Group also successfully entered the Capital Market with an Initial Public Offering of Rs 1200cr. Services are as varied as the interior designing done by Morph Design Company (MDC) and the redefinition of elegance and suave in men's formal dressing by Prestige Fashions (P) Ltd.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Bhayandarpada, Thane",Rs 75.1 Lac - Rs 1.64 Cr,"2,3 BHK Flats",Rs 10333,1209,6 Acre,"2,3","Club House, Swimming Pool, Security, Reserved Parking, Rain Water Harvesting, Mini Cinema Theatre, Fire Fighting Equipment",7,"Commercial hubs in Pokhran and Waghbil - 15-20 mins | Mumbai City (Eastern Suburbs) - 30 mins | Mumbai City (Western Suburbs) - 30 mins | South Mumbai via Eastern Freeway - 60 mins | Ghatkopar via Kasarvadavli Metro Station - 30 mins | Wadala via Kasarvadavli Metro Station - 40 mins | Thane Railway Station - 24 mins | Bhayandar Railway Station - 36 mins | Borivali Railway Station - 33 mins | Kapurbawdi Monorail Station - 15 mins | Project USP

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million.

We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Often, these structures shape more than just the environments and lifestyles of the people living in them; they shape the future blueprints of entire cities. At Rustomjee, it is our constant endeavour to transform the city with every building of ours. When we incorporate playgrounds and swimming pools into our designs, it's not just to offer our customer better amenities, but to offer their children better childhoods. When we push ourselves to find innovative solutions, it is not so much to save costs, as it is to save our environment.As a developer, Rustomjee has always believed that form follows function. This is evident in every aspect of our design and the way we plan homes. Rustomjee also lays special emphasis on the quality of its homes and expects everyone in the team to follow the rule of 'Better, not cheaper'. We realise that buying of a home is more than just a transaction; it is the realisation of an important dream. Which is why, customer-centricity is the very essence of our brand DNA and the many satisfied customers we've had bear testimony to this fact.Rustomjee also believes in giving back to the society within which we function and our education initiatives are one of many steps we've taken in this direction. By identifying potential, giving everyone equal opportunity and nurturing talent, we're helping create the next generation of leaders. Since we set out on this journey, we have transformed 10 million sq ft square feet of the city into premium townships, corporate parks, retail spaces and over 8,500 homes. In the last five years alone, we've delivered 8 million sq ft square feet of construction area, with a special focus on the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.As we move forward, we hope to go from strength to strength, and aim to add another 13 million sq ft square feet to our portfolio in the next five years.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Mahalunge, Pune",73 Lac,"2,3 BHK Flats",Rs 7684,741,11 Acre,N/A,"Club House, Cafeteria/Food Court, Bar/Lounge, Jogging and Strolling Track, Outdoor Tennis Courts, Power Back Up, Swimming Pool, Lift, Security, Park, Reserved Parking, Service/Goods Lift, Visitor Parking, Maintenance Staff, Banquet Hall, Gymnasium, DTH Television Facility, Laundry Service, Piped Gas, Rain Water Harvesting, RO Water System, Water Storage, Waste Disposal, Conference Room, CCTV Camera",25,There is a Palm court with central fountain | Connectivity: NH-48 (10 min) | Mumbai - Pune Expressway (25 min) | Budget Home | Assured Rental | Smart Investment,Balewadi High Street - 5 kms | D-Mart - 2.5 kms | Balewadi Stadium - 5.3 kms,"Concealed electrification with modular type switches of reputed make.

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Wadala, Mumbai",4.29 Cr,"2,3 BHK Flats",Rs 21889,370,7 Acre,"2,3","Club House, Jogging and Strolling Track, Barbeque Pit, Power Back Up, Swimming Pool, Lift, Security, Park, Reserved Parking, Visitor Parking, Intercom Facility, Maintenance Staff, Banquet Hall, Gymnasium, Rain Water Harvesting, Water Storage, Indoor Squash & Badminton Courts, Meditation Area, Vaastu Compliant, Fingerprint Access, Waste Disposal, Pool with temperature control, Earth quake resistant, Large Clubhouse, 3 Tier Security System, Grand Entrance lobby, Multipurpose Hall, CCTV Camera, Entry Exit Gate, Kids play area, Half basketball court, Aesthetically designed landscape garden, Badminton court",33,"Great Connectivity by Road and Rail and Ultra-modern amenities | 1.37 Acres Land | All Modern Amenities - Ground Level, Podium Level & EXCLUSIVE rooftop amenities larger then life. | Ultra Luxurious, Spacious & Well Ventilated 3 BHKs with Balcony & Servant quarter in each apartment (1400 - 1500sqft) | 3 appartments per floor for privacy and space. | 3 Covered Surface Car Parks with each apartment | Big Carpet Area, big Land Parcel | Fully Sea view, Unhindered views of the hills from your balcony | Lush green park | Five garden 2 mins | Wadala station 1.5 km | Close proximity to nature | Unhindered views of the hills from your balcony | Lush green park | Multi-specialty hospitals in close proximity | All shops for daily needs and requirements within the premises | Easy availability of various modes of public transportation | A preferred residential destination for many IT professionals",,"Master Bedroom-Walls: Oil Bound Distemper

Each Godrej Properties development combines a 123&ndash;year legacy of excellence and trust with a commitment to cutting-edge design and technology.In recent years, Godrej Properties has received over 250 awards and recognitions, including 'The Most Trusted Real Estate Brand' in 2019 from the Brand Trust Report, 'Real Estate Company of the Year' at the 9th Construction Week Awards 2019, &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Champion' 2019 at the APREA Property Leaders Awards, &lsquo;The Economic Times Best Real Estate Brand 2018' and the &lsquo;Builder of the Year' at the CNBC-Awaaz Real Estate Awards 2018.Our projects over the years have delivered many firsts in the Indian real estate market. Planet Godrej, a skyscraper in Mumbai, was India's tallest occupied building when completed in 2008. It also illustrated our focus on customer safety and wellbeing by becoming the first project in the country to offer residents a fire escape chute. Our commercial office project, Godrej BKC, is the only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rated building in India's leading commercial district, Bandra Kurla Complex, demonstrating Godrej Properties' commitment to environmental sustainability. It is also the project where we broke the record for India's highest ever commercial end-user sales transaction when a large multinational pharmaceutical company purchased space in this project for INR 1,479 crore in 2015. Our flagship project, The Trees, is one of India's most sustainably planned mixed-use projects that we hope will contribute to the evolution of urban design thinking in the country. We sold over INR 1,200 crore worth of space within six months of launching this project in 2015, making it one of the country's most successful residential project launches.With an estimated 10 million Indians moving into the urban areas annually, the country's urban landscape is likely to change dramatically in the coming decades. We firmly believe that India must seize on the opportunity to urbanize in a sustainable manner. Our group has always been at the forefront of the environmental sustainability movement. The CII-Godrej Green Building Center in Hyderabad, when it was completed in 2004, was the first LEED Platinum building outside of the United States and was the single highest rated LEED building in the world.&nbsp; In 2010, Godrej Properties committed that every single project we develop will be a certified green building. Many of our projects have since received LEED Platinum certifications, which are globally recognized as the leading sustainability recognitions. Our large township project, Godrej Garden City, in Ahmedabad was selected as one of only 2 projects in India and 16 worldwide by The Clinton Foundation to partner with them in the goal of achieving a climate positive development. In 2016, we stood 2nd in Asia and 5th in the world in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking) study, which is an industry led sustainability and governance benchmarking platform.&nbsp;In 2010, Godrej Properties became a publicly listed company through a successful IPO in which it raised USD 100 million. Godrej Properties also created a fund management subsidiary in 2016; Godrej Fund Management raised USD 275 million in the year's largest residential real estate focused fund raise in the country. We are one of India's only national developers with a strong presence across the country's leading real estate markets. In the financial year 2016, for the first time, Godrej Properties was India's largest publicly listed real estate developer by sales value having sold over INR 5,000 crore of real estate that year.&nbsp; In the same year, we also delivered 0.56 million square meters (6 million square feet) of real estate in seven cities across India.We believe that it's the people working at Godrej Properties who allow us to build an outstanding company that is bubbling with talent, dynamism, and inspiration. In recognition of our people and practices, Godrej Properties has been ranked as the number one real estate developer and amongst the top fifty companies overall four consecutive times by the Great Places to Work Institute in partnership with the Economic Times.","Whitefield, Bangalore",85 Lac,"2,3 BHK Flats",Rs 7194,2052,18 Acre,"2,3","Club House, Cafeteria/Food Court, Jogging and Strolling Track, Cycling & Jogging Track, Power Back Up, Swimming Pool, Lift, Security, Park, Reserved Parking, Service/Goods Lift, Visitor Parking, Maintenance Staff, Gymnasium, Indoor Games Room, Rain Water Harvesting, Water Storage, Indoor Squash & Badminton Courts, Multipurpose Courts, Meditation Area, Vaastu Compliant, Waste Disposal, Mini Cinema Theatre, Earth quake resistant, Multipurpose Hall, Solar Energy, CCTV Camera, Kids play area, Cricket net practice, Aesthetically designed landscape garden, Provision for power backup, Event Space & Amphitheatre",32,"A developed residential locality and a well-known IT hub situated on the eastern periphery of Bengaluru | Preferred residential destination for people working in the nearby tech parks such as International Tech Park, EPIP Zone, GR Tech Park and Sigma Tech Park | Apartments equipped with home automation features | Working pods installed at amenity zone | Rapidly expanding neighborhood of Whitefield | Spread across a sprawling 18 acres of land | Featuring the very best in Godrej Properties' premium living segment. | Luxurious amenities and facilities. | 50+ amenities and 650+ trees will be planted | 7 acres of central amenity podium | Equipped with smart lockers for your online delivery | Unique facilities such as Cycling & Jogging Track, Swimming Pool, Reserved Parking available in Godrej Splendour | Smart, clean, green, secure, beautiful | Intelligent and innovative use of space | Abundant natural light and ventilation | Convenient and comfortable | 5min drive from ITPL | Pheonix mall 20min drive | DPS - 5min drive | KR Puram Railway Station 15min drive | KGIA 45min drive",,"<address>STRUCTURE:&nbsp; RCC Structure with cement block masonry</address><address>
